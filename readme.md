# Tennis Kata

This Kata is about implementing a simple tennis scoring system

## Rules
1. Each player starts with 0 point.
2. Each player can have either of these points in one game 0 15 30 40
3. If you have 40 points and you win the ball, you'll win the game. However, there are special rules.
4. If both players have 40 points, players are in 'deuce'   

### Deuce:   

```bash
- If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage.
- If the player with advantage wins the ball, he will win the game.
- If the player without advantage wins, they will be back at deuce.

```
